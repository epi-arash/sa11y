The Selenium Accessibility Project

Get basic accessibility information using
the [axe-core npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core)
on websites visited using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/).

Contact [Deque](https://www.deque.com/) for more information about axe™ functionality and results.
